### About `trapezoid-react`

This project is a continuation of a Python3 program, `trapezoid.py`, that was converted into a vanilla JavaScript file, `trapezoid.js`, and now into a much nicer and more useful interface as `trapezoid-react`. See <https://github.com/bost-ty/trapezoid> for more information on the origins of this project.
